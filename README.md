# Raven

Raven stands for "Real-time Attentive Video Enhancement Network". It is inspired by the three-eyed raven in game of thrones, who has "a thousand eyes and one", and apparently sees everything. The three eyed raven is magic of course, but we are pretty good at using modern technology to build something similar.

On one side, we have a lot of traffic cameras with live video streams, although most humans are probably disinterested in devoting their attention to these videos. On the other hand, computer vision has progressed a lot over the last few years, thanks to deep learning. For some jobs it may do better than human. So we can basically put 2 and 2 together and build Raven.

Raven is implemented by the following data pipeline:
